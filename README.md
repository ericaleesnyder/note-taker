# note-taker

## Description

This assignment was my first foray into using express and working with my own server.

This application serves as a note taker. The user has the opportunity to revisit previously entered notes as well as add additional notes through an intuitive interface. 

Because this is a full stack application, the notes are not reliant on local storage.

This project furthered my understanding of the interaction between api get/post requests and fetch requests. It was a challenging task. I learned the importance of deploying early to heroku to avoid deployment errors. 

The deployed version of the application can be found at:
